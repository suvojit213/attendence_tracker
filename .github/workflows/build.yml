#
# 🚀 Enhanced Flutter Build, Release, and Notify Workflow 🚀
#
# What's new and improved?
# 1.  **Semantic Versioning**: Reads the version directly from your `pubspec.yaml` file.
# 2.  **Dedicated Actions**: Uses specialized GitHub Actions for cleaner, more reliable code.
# 3.  **Enhanced Security**: Fetches secrets securely using `secrets.VARIABLE_NAME`.
# 4.  **FIXED**: Correctly displays the release timestamp.
# 5.  **FIXED & UPGRADED ✨**: Replaced the problematic changelog generator with `mikepenz/release-changelog-builder-action`, a more reliable and popular action to fix the "action not found" error.
